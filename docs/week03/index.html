	<h1>Organization and Access</h1>
	<p>All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and thinking. In this, they are very
	similar to spoken languages. Each spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
	differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example.
	German, a language closely related to English, organizes things differently. Sometimes German sentences have a
        Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb structure...
	Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish has adjectives 
	after the nouns they modify.</p>
	<p>While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the same thing. They allow us to organize and express
	our thinking.</p>
	<h3>Functions - the fundimental organization concept of C</h3>
	<p>C, and its descendent language Python, have functions as a fundimental organizational structure. When you truly begin 
	thinking in C, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how functions are related to each other. You will 
	have thoughts along these lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this since you will eventually
	realize that when you are designing solutions in C, how a function accomplishes something is not as important as that it will, 
	and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the function later.</p>
	
	<p>Put an example here of desinging a solution thinking in functions.</p>
	<p>Since Python is a descendent of C, there are similarities and differences between the languages regarding how you declare 
	functions.

	<h3>Libraries - sharing your functions with others</h3>
	<p> A higher order organizational idea in C is library. Libraries are a way that you can share your code for other programmers 
	to use in their applications, and you can share your code with them. Libraries are compiled groups of functions that, unlike 
	applications, can not run on their own. Instead, you use what other people have written and compiled as if you wrote it yourself.</p>
	<h4>Libraries - structure and compilation</h4>
	<p>For others to know about your functions, you create a header file. You have used others libraries alread without knowing 
	what you were doing. Each time you put #include in your application....</p>

	<h3>Pointers - keeping track of where things are</h3>
	<p>Because of when and for what it was created, the PDP-11 computer, C has a language structure many other languages do not...
	the pointer. A pointer is a way of keeping track of where something is in RAM. It points to the thing.</p>
